<!-- okay so what we doing here Jade is like, okay so you have an initial
  page of divs, and then you click one and everything conforms to that sort of thing,
  maybe you clik about and see what happens.

  will the user be inclined to just click?
  hmm. i mean you could put them all in one div in a grid of 4 or 6 and just have the picks change..

  yeah that does work i suppose.

  okay so first step is setting up the 3 rounds of divs with the 3 themes.

  then in the javascript you make it that there is one that is differnet, maybe it fades in
  and when you click it brings you other things similar
