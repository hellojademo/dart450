// This file defines a variable with our dialog in it
//
// Each element in the dialog array is an object with two properties:
//
//    'name' contains the name of the person saying the line
//     and conveniently translates to the name of the CSS id for that
//     character.
//
//    'line' contains the line of dialog for them to speak
//
// The elements are in the array IN THE ORDER that they should be spoken
// by the characters.
